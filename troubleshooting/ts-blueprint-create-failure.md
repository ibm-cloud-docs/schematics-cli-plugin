{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} Blueprints is a [beta feature](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-bp-beta-limitations) that are available for evaluation and testing purposes. It is not intended for production usage. Refer to the list of [limitations](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-bp-beta-limitations#sc-bp-beta-limitation) for the beta release.

# Blueprint create fails 
{: #bp-create-fails}

Review the following sections to help debugging blueprint apply failures. 

## Blueprint create fails with an invalid blueprint template: failed to clone Git repository error
{: #bp-create-fails1}

When you create a blueprint configuration, the create fails with an error that the template, or input repositories cannot be cloned or found. 
{: tsSymptoms}

When you create the configuration, {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} attempts to download the input files and blueprint template from the Git repositories that are specified on the create and validate the YAML schema. 
{: tsCauses}

Sample error

```text
FAILED
Could not create the blueprint. Please verify that your request is correct. If the problem persists, contact IBM Cloud support.

Invalid blueprint templates. Error - Failed to clone git repository, repository not found (check url, also check the scope 'repo' of the personal access token if SCHEMATICSGITTOKEN is used)
```
{: screen}

Check that the source repositories for the templates and input files are correctly specified, the referenced files and repository exists and is accessible with Git tokens specified whether necessary.
{: tsResolve} 

Rerun the blueprint create operation with the correct repository reference.

## Blueprint create fails with an invalid blueprint template: unable to find file error
{: #bp-create-fails2}

When you create the configuration, the create fails before the config is created with an error that the template, or input files cannot be found.
{: tsSymptoms}

When you create the configuration, {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} attempts to download the input files, and template from the Git repositories that are specified on the create and validate the YAML schema. The repository was located, but the template or input files cannot be found. 
{: tsCauses}

Sample error

```text
FAILED
Could not create the blueprint. Please verify that your request is correct. If the problem persists, contact IBM Cloud support.

Invalid blueprint templates. Error - Unable to find basic-blueprint1.yaml in the target repo
```
{: screen}

Check that the template file and input files that are identified in the error message exist in the target repository and are correctly specified on the config create. 
{: tsResolve} 

Rerun the create operation with the correct file name.

## Blueprint create fails with the requested resource group as invalid
{: #bp-create-fails3}

When you create the configuration, the create fails before the config is created with an error that the requested resource group ID is invalid or needed permissions.  
{: tsSymptoms}

On creation, blueprints are assigned to the {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} management resource group passed on the create. If the group is invalid or the user does not have the correct {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} IAM permissions for the group the create operation will fail.
{: tsCauses}

Sample error

```text
FAILED
Could not create the blueprint. Please verify that your request is correct. If the problem persists, contact IBM Cloud support.

The requested resource group id is invalid or required permissions for performing the action are not present on resource group. Please check the resource group ID and permissions.
```
{: screen}

Check that the resource group that is specified on the `--resource_group` option is valid and that the user has the correct {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} [IAM permissions](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-access#blueprint-permissions) to create blueprints.
{: tsResolve} 

Rerun the blueprints create operation with the correct group name or permissions.

## Blueprint create fails with the error blueprint JSON validation failed: field missing or invalid in config
{: #bp-create-fails4}

When you create the configuration, the create fails before the config is created with the error that the config JSON validation failed due to an invalid or missing field in the config.
{: tsSymptoms}

On create, {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} validates that all the template inputs are satisfied. If inputs are missing the validation fails, and the create stops.
{: tsCauses}

Sample error

```text
FAILED
Could not create the blueprint. Please verify that your request is correct. If the problem persists, contact IBM Cloud support.

Invalid blueprint templates. Error - Blueprint json validation failed - Field `config[resource_group_name]` missing or invalid - Value for resource_group_name not defined in config
```
{: screen}

The blueprint template is expecting more input values that are not specified in any of the input files or passed as dynamic inputs. The error output lists name of the expected missing or invalid input. Check the template readme file to determine the needed dynamic inputs or add the input to an input file.
{: tsResolve} 

Rerun the blueprint create operation with all the needed inputs. 

## Blueprint create fails with the error blueprint JSON validation failed - field missing or invalid
{: #bp-create-fails5}

When you create a configuration in {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}}, the create fails before the config is created with an error that the config contains invalid definitions.  
{: tsSymptoms}

The blueprint create validates the syntax of the YAML blueprint template file. If the syntax is specified incorrectly the create fails. 
{: tsCauses}

Sample error 

```text
Could not create the blueprint. Please verify that your request is correct. If the problem exists, contact IBM Cloud support.

Invalid blueprint templates. Error - Blueprint json validation failed - Field `blueprint.modules` missing or invalid
```
{: screen}

Correct the errors as identified in the validation messages. For more information about the syntax, see [blueprint template YAML schema](/docs/schematics?topic=schematics-bp-template-schema-yaml). 
{: tsResolve}

Push the changes to template and input files to the Git repositories.

Rerun the blueprint create operation with the corrected syntax.

## Why is {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} not able to clone the private GitHub repository?
{: #tsg-privategithub}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} isn't able to clone the private GitHub repository, and you are seeing the following error message: `Failed to clone git repository, repository not found (check url, also check the scope 'repo' of the personal access token if SCHEMATICSGITTOKEN is used)`
{: tsSymptoms}

You didn't provide the correct GitHub token, or you didn't provide a GitHub token altogether.
{: tsCauses}

Provide a [GitHub token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token){: external} and check to see whether the correct GitHub token has been provided in the `github_token` parameter in the create workspace or create blueprint API.
{: tsResolve}

## Why is {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} not able to clone the public GitHub repository?
{: #tsg-publicgithub}
{: troubleshoot}
{: support}

{{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} isn't able to clone the public GitHub repository, and you are seeing one of the following error messages:

* `Fatal, could not download repo, Failed to clone git repository, authentication required (or the git url is incorrect). Problems found with the Repository. Please Rectify and Retry`
* `Template error: Failed to clone git repository, authentication required (or the git url is incorrect)`
{: tsSymptoms}

You didn't provide the correct GitHub URL, or you provided a GitHub token, which is not required to clone a public repository. A GitHub access token is only required to access a private repository.
{: tsCauses}

Do not provide a GitHub token, and check to see whether the GitHub token was provided in the `github_token` parameter while creating a workspace or blueprint by using the public repository.
{: tsResolve}
